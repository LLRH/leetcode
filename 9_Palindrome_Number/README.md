Determine whether an integer is an palindrome.
An integer is palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

-   Example 1:

```bash
Input: 121
Output: true
```

-   Example 2:

```bash
Input: -121
Output: false
Expanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindorme.
```

-   Example 3:

```bash
Input: 10
Output: flae
Expanation: Reads 10 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindorme.
```
